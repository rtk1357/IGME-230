# Mole Control

### High Concept
Whack-a-mole crossed with shoot-em-up, where the moles build walls to defend themselves.

#### Genre: Action, Casual

#### Platform: Desktop-Only

### Story
In this game, moles have grown tired of solely living underground and want to expand their kingdom into the world above.  They plan to start building immediately, and as pest-control, the player's job is to halt the construction by shooting the mole builders as they appear from their holes.  The game will have a light-hearted playful mood, just like the original whack-a-mole game, with the thrill of trying to defeat the moles before they can hide back in their holes.

### Aesthetics
The game will have a very simple, cartoonish graphics style.  Soundwise, it will have a looped background music that is consistent with the light-hearted playful tone, with additional bleep/bloop sound effects when the player fires a bullet or takes out a mole.  Additional sound-effects may be added for when a mole completes construction and escapes successfully and when the player loses or wins the game.

### Gameplay
##### Mechanics and Controls
The player will control an avatar that can move around the screen using the wasd keys and rotate based on the position of the mouse cursor.  Clicking the left mouse button will cause the player to fire a bullet in the direction they're facing, which will take out a mole on contact.  The moles will appear from their holes, and after a short delay, build a wall and disappear back into their hole.  The walls cannot be walked through and will block bullets. Once the player kills enough moles or the time limit runs out, the game will end.  The time that the moles are vulnerable will decrease as the game goes on.

##### Teaching the Game
The game will be taught through a one-page instructions screen that will be linked to from the main menu.

##### Player Learning
As the game itself is very simple and relies more on hand-eye coordination and reflexes then anything else, the player will need to learn very little in order to beat the game.  Rather, they will simply continue to play until they get an intuitive sense of where they need to be, when.
